# How to use the Challenge App

#### After loading the site you are greeted with the setup menu.

#### Here you need to enter your group's name into the "Team name" field (at least 3 characters)

#### Then you enter the location code in the "Location" field (1 Letter and 1 Number)

#### The number indicates how many points you will receive  after completing the task.

#### After submitting both you get to the main page where a challenge is displayed.

#### When you have finished the challenge you can press the "finish" button, which opens another window where you have to confirm that you are finished. When you do you are sent back to the "setup" screen where you can enter a new location.

#### Alternatively there is a "Aufgeben" button, which takes you back to the "setup" screen.
